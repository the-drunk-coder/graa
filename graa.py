# IDEAS:
# learning: store paths, rate performances, automatically play on that basis ? 
# centralized clock for collaborative graaing ?
# node locking mode ? (give nodes a duration ?)
# configurable resolution for non-realtime systems ? how, if it's strongly timed ... :(

# TO BE DONE:
# tbd: make everything more robust (changing graphs during playing etc ...)
# tbd: resetting graphs
# tbd: validation: all nodes reachable etc ?
# tbd: re-sync graphs on beat (restart command ?)
# tbd: graphs containing graphs, for longer compositions !
# tbd: edge probability modification 
# tbd: edge duration modification
# tbd: peristent modifications ?
# tbd: supercollider backend
# tbd: multiple edges at once: b1-500->b2-500->b3 ?
# tbd: edge rebalancing (subtract equally from existing edges if not enough prob left)
# tbd: documentation
# tbd: play modes: markov, manual, beat (?)
# tbd: manual timeshift: d1@+/-x
# tbd: multi-command lines
# tbd: add overlay kwargs if not present
# tbd: mute nodes through overlays
# tbd: two overlay modes d <<plus>> ol: non-persistent, only apply functions, d <<permaplus>> ol: store values
# tbd: graph generators: tree, triforce, bjoerklund, cross, etc (see notes)
# tbd: write graph transformers, like, reverse, tournament, rotate (?)
