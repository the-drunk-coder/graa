# IDEAS:
# learning: store paths, rate performances, automatically play on that basis ? 
# centralized clock for collaborative graaing ?
# node locking mode ? (give nodes a duration ?)
# configurable resolution for non-realtime systems ? how, if it's strongly timed ... :(

# TO BE DONE:
# tbd: yasnippets for functions
# tbd: nested function evaluation for overlay functions
# tbd: selctively expand edges and nodes ??
# tbd: precise scheduling ...
# tbd: validation: all nodes reachable etc ?
# tbd: re-sync graphs on beat (restart command ?)
# tbd: graphs containing graphs, for longer compositions !
# tbd: edge probability modification
# tbd: supercollider backend
# tbd: edge rebalancing (subtract equally from existing edges if not enough prob left) (ESP for edge mods!!)
# tbd: documentation
# tbd: play modes: markov, manual, beat (?)
# tbd: add overlay kwargs if not present
# tbd: graph generators: tree, triforce, bjoerklund, cross, etc (see notes)
# tbd: write graph transformers, like, reverse, tournament, rotate (?)
