# IDEAS:
# learning: store paths, rate performances, automatically play on that basis ? 
# centralized clock for collaborative graaing ?
# node locking mode ? (give nodes a duration ?)
# configurable resolution for non-realtime systems ? how, if it's strongly timed ... :(

# TO BE DONE (for next releases ...)
# tbd: fix "lag" when manipulating graphs !!
# tbd: short syntax for microtonal elements in pitch notation
# tbd: add overlay kwargs if not present (in doubt on default value)
# tbd: avoid namespace conflicts between sound- and overlay functions ...
# tbd: avoid "hidden edges" ... ?
# tbd: more ChucK backend functions
# tbd: write abstractions / generators for common functions
# tbd: emacs expand for moar lines !
# tbd: more precise scheduling ... ?
# tbd: validation: all nodes reachable etc ?
# tbd: re-sync graphs on beat (restart command ?)
# tbd: graphs containing graphs, for longer compositions ?
# tbd: edge probability modification
# tbd: edge rebalancing (subtract equally from existing edges if not enough prob left) (ESP for edge mods!!)
# tbd: documentation
# tbd: graph generators: grid, tree, triforce, bjoerklund, etc (see notes)
# tbd: write graph transformers, like, reverse, tournament, rotate (?) 
# tbd: performance recorder ?
# tbd: configurable default start mode ...
